# Kesterlyn Wilson – Bioinformatics & Product Systems Portfolio

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of my academic, professional, and personal projects in **bioinformatics**, **cheminformatics**, and **technical product systems**.  
Each folder contains independent scripts, workflows, and supporting documentation from coursework, internal biotech process development, and side research projects.

I’m currently an Application Scientist based in Boston, MA, with experience in genomic data troubleshooting, product iteration, and applied data science.  
This portfolio highlights my transition from **bioinformatic technical support** to **computational biology and AI-assisted product design**.
