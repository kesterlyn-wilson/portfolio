# FASTQ QC Summary

**Description:**  
This lightweight Python script parses FASTQ quality metric files and outputs a summary table of key run metrics, including read counts, GC content, average quality scores, and sequence length distribution. Itâ€™s designed for quick QC checks of raw sequencing data prior to downstream analysis.

**Use Case**  
The script can be used by NGS support teams, bioinformaticians, or lab scientists who want to:
- Validate sequencing run quality
- Compare read metrics across samples
- Identify low-quality or biased libraries before alignment

### ðŸš€ Features
- Parses standard FASTQ or text-based QC outputs  
- Computes key metrics (mean Q-score, read length, GC%)  
- Exports results as a clean CSV summary  
- Compatible with outputs from tools like FastQC, SeqKit, or custom log files
